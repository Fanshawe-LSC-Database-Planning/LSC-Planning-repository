					</p>
					<p>
						Dear Ms./Mr. <b>[insert Last Name]:</b>
					</p>

					<p>Fanshawe College is pleased to offer you employment on the
						terms and conditions outlined below.</p>

					<p>
						Your role will be as <b>[Professor, Counsellor, Librarian]</b> in
						the [faculty name] in the School of <b>[insert name]</b>,
						commencing on <b>[insert date]</b> and ending without further
						notice on <b>[insert date]</b> with duties, terms and conditions
						as outlined in the Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology
						Academic Collective Agreement, a copy of which is enclosed. Please
						note Article 26 (Partial Load Employees), in particular. The
						College reserves the right to assign you teaching within any
						school and at any campus operated by the College.
					</p>

					<p>
						This is a partial-load appointment with remuneration as outlined
						in the collective agreement, starting at <b>[$insert hourly
							rate]</b> per teaching contact hour, <b>[Step xx,]</b> as indicated
						in the enclosed salary calculation form. The hourly rate includes
						vacation pay and is paid for all teaching contact hours taught and
						compensates for other time spent on ancillary duties including,
						but not limited to class preparation, assignment/exam grading
						(including final exam) invigilation, uploading end of term grades
						by (insert final date), student communication, and meeting
						attendances outside of classroom hours. (If applicable, note any
						exclusions during this period â€“ for example, study week) Academic
						Staff are paid bi-weekly by direct bank deposit.
					</p>

					<p>This offer of employment is conditional upon there being
						sufficient enrolment and or availability of work, which is solely
						at the discretion on the College. Nothing in this offer should be
						construed as guaranteeing any particular number of hours per week.
						You agree that if work is not available or there is not sufficient
						enrolment, this employment agreement is void and no compensation
						or obligations will be provided to you from the College. The
						College will inform you if there is not sufficient enrollment or
						availability of work prior to the scheduled start date or planned
						commencement of the term of this agreement.</p>

					<p>If during the term of this appointment you wish to resign or
						if the College finds it necessary to terminate your employment, a
						written notice of 30 days is required. The College may terminate
						your employment at any time for cause without notice or pay in
						lieu of notice.</p>

					<p>You will receive vacation and public holiday pay
						entitlements pursuant to the Employment Standards Act, 2000.</p>

					<p>You agree that your accrued statutory vacation pay will be
						paid out each pay period. You further agree that the College may
						provide you with statutory holiday pay for statutory holidays that
						fall on a day that would not ordinarily be a working day for you
						or that fall on a day that you are on vacation, instead of
						providing you with a substitute day off with statutory holiday
						pay.</p>

					<p>You agree that the College is entitled to recover any
						overpayment that may have been made to you under this or any other
						contract between you and the College. You agree that the College
						will be entitled to offset any such overpayment against any wages
						otherwise owed to you on the pay period following notice to you of
						the overpayment. Should your employment be severed prior to the
						repayment in full of any overpayment, you agree that any
						outstanding monies owed due at the date of termination will be
						deducted from any monies owing to you by the College, including
						final wages, outstanding vacation pay, termination and/or
						severance pay.</p>

					<p>This offer is conditional upon the College's receipt of
						evidence of your highest academic credential directly from the
						granting agency and our assessment of Canadian equivalency, where
						applicable. This documentation is to be received by the College
						prior to your effective date of hire, or in any event, within
						fourteen (14) days of the date of this letter. If for any reason
						this documentation cannot be received within the above-noted
						timeframe, please contact the Chief Human Resources Officer, who
						will determine an appropriate course of action.</p>

					<p>If upon receipt of your academic credentials, the College
						determines that you do not hold the requisite credentials or that
						you in any way misrepresented your credentials, this offer is null
						and void. If you have commenced employment, the foregoing shall
						constitute grounds for the immediate termination of your
						employment.</p>

					<p>You are not permitted to accept other appointments or
						contracts within the College without the advance written
						permission of your manager. This confirms you have advised that
						you currently [are/are not] engaged in other employment or
						contractual relations with Fanshawe College [as follows: insert
						other teaching assignments, support work or vendor/contractual
						relationships].</p>

					<p>
						You are required to review and comply with all College policies
						and procedures, as established from time to time. These policies
						and procedures can be accessed on the Fanshawe College web site at
						www.fanshawec.ca/about-us/corporate-information/college-policies.</a>
